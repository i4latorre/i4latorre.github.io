# Personal Website i4latorre

This repository hosts the source code for my personal website, built as a static GitHub Pages site.

The site serves as a central place for professional information, project descriptions, and research-related material.
It is not intended to function as a software library or standalone application, but rather as a public-facing personal page.

## Structure

The repository contains the HTML, CSS, and supporting assets required to generate and deploy the website via GitHub Pages.
Content and layout are customized for personal use.

## Credits

The original HTML/CSS template is based on the **HTML5 UP** framework by @zce.
